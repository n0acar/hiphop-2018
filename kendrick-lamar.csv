The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you know what I'm saying it's gonna be like... there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich[|]Aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that's rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?[|]I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin', I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I'm saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying. I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us[|]And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?[|]By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in "all good things come to those that stay true." You know what I'm saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying, I was noticing, shit, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it's no problem, you know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know. I'm finna go straight through[|]Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?[|]Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back[|]Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down[|]In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. And you don't wanna fight no more. And if you don't believe me you can look around, you don't see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas[|]That's crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?[|]I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be, like, uh, bloodshed for real. I don't think America know that. I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka. You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen[|]That's crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people don't understand how important it is.

Interlude,
Keep It Thoro,
Keep It Thoro (Freestyle),
: Rapper of the Year - GQ,Reminder that you can click the images for more annotations.[|]Every member of rap's Mount Rushmore dropped new albums in 2013-Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Eminem-but it was another MC altogether who stole the crown, and he did it with just a handful of verses: Kendrick Lamar, the latest-and possibly greatest-rapper to come straight outta Compton.[|]We are 10,000 feet above Compton in a private jet, and Kendrick Lamar is explaining to me what happened to him yesterday, when he vanished. We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.[|]It turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his "little bro"-a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick's parents' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.[|]So today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City's fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn't sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, he's telling me about Chad. "It all happened when I was overseas," he says. "I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed."[|]It's been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds-one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever-and since then his legend has spread fast.[|]It actually began late last year, when Kendrick's major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The album-about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom's minivan chasing "that crazy-ass girl Sherane"-is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap's violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He's the game's most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest-the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude's house-and it's this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you're putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast-Beach House samples, Dungeon Family lushness-but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:[|]If Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean's song "Control"-a guest spot on a song that didn't even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself "the king of New York," which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector.[|]"Control" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.[|]Kendrick's career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton's memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it "back to the set" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. "It can be complicated and confusing," Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. "From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous-I still live in this world." And when someone back home needs something, "I still gotta get that phone call."[|]It's clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.[|]A bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: "When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn't mean real life will follow." Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: "Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy."[|]On the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over "Control" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on "Control," and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drake's VMA performance of "Hold On, We're Going Home," Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. "You watch," he joked, "I'm going to be singing by my fifth album!"[|]I asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. "Pretty cool." Shrugs. "And I mean, I would be okay if we weren't."[|]A month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake's new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the "Control" thing: "You can't just say that and then see me and be like, 'Yeah, man, what's up?'-pretending like nothing ever happened." Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped "Control" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.[|]I got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public lash-out-"Control" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. "Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis," Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn't look up to Drake, doesn't see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, "No-peer. If anything. We all peers."[|]When Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he's not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds.[|]"I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom's couch. I'm 26 now-it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. I'm not huge on superstition and all that shit. That's what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, 'Don't let the music die.' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he's right there. Just a silhouette."[|]The visit from Pac changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. "It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin'," he explains. "I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there's people out there that can't really connect to that lifestyle. They're in the struggle."[|]Much of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos-some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton-and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. "When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets-nobody never really knows," he says. "But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman."[|]A few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick's Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, "Aw, man, I can't go to no club."[|]Kendrick spoke up.[|]"We have to go."[|]"Look at you! We have to go. You're never we have to go."[|]"You know me," Kendrick explained. "I only go when there's a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!"[|]Twenty minutes later, Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith, basically TDE's Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. "You guys seem so calm," I said.[|]"Well," Tiffith told me, "we're going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand."[|]The gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati-Jay, Bey-mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the "King of New York" boast, attempted to pour a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. "It was all love at that party," he told me on the private jet.[|]After we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenné Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: "We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas."[|]By the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. There's chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for "Swimming Pools (Drank)," a song about his family's dark relationship with chemical dependency-Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK-a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.[|]It's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg's booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. "I don't know," he says. "It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I'll be, or how happy I'll be, or how confused I'll be."[|]At one point on good kid Kendrick raps, "I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous". The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the inversion of rap's consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because he's already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising.

Writer At War: 's XXL Cover Story,Writer At WarKendrick Lamar in his own words.A lot of times in interviews, people ask me things like, "How does it feel now? What have you bought your mom and your pops and family?" Nobody ever really asks about what it's like trying to adapt to fame and money and how much of a depression it can make for you. How much of a depression it could put you in knowing that so many kids hang on to your words. I can't make a song like "i" without being in that dark place. "i" comes from going overseas, going to New York, being in L.A. and hearing kids saying, "Kendrick, I was gonna kill myself last week. Section.80, good kid, m.A.A.d city saved my life." Or "I was gonna kill myself tonight until I came to your show."[|]I believe that they are telling the truth. At first I wasn't so sure, maybe it was just they were excited to meet me. But then they showed me their wrists and had all these different scars from when they tried to take their lives but failed. Or I look into their eyes and their pupils are dilated and they on all these types of meds and drugs, it's a whole different story to me. That's when I learned that while I'm making music for myself, drawing from my own experiences and conflictions and battles within myself, this teenager listens to every word I say. And that's spooky[|]I think one of my biggest battles within myself is embracing leadership. You always grow up and you hate the term "role model." You would say, "I don't wanna be a role model. I don't want none of that." But in actuality, you are the biggest role model. It's impossible to fight the title of role model. Especially when the type of music I make is so personal. People feel like they can relate to me or that they are me. They feel like they know my whole life story even though we from different worlds. So when I go out and meet them in public, I don't get a response like, "Kendrick, will you sign this real quick?" Or, "I wanna just take this picture with you." No, they want to have full conversations. I find out that they live their lives by my music and that right there is something[|][Kendrick Lamar's XXL Cover Story - Second Clip]When I try to soak it all in, that's the only thing that kind've scare me, feel me? Life is sad in general and I'm meeting these different people every day. It kind've snaps me back into reality outside of what I do. Outside of the girls, outside of the cars, the money, it really ain't that important when you meeting somebody that's still in the struggle. These the people that live their lives in dark spaces, every day , you know, and they use my music as some sort of tool to keep going, almost like a Bible, you know? These kids feel like they got nothing to believe in but they see me and say, "Kendrick, I believe in you. I believe in your music." And what happens it puts me in some type of space where it's almost like some type of worship or responsibility, but I know it. I can see it[|]Anything I say or do, I don't take back, I don't regret.I think one of my biggest assets is not knowing how famous I am. Or even excluding the word, I hate the word "famous." I'm aware of it. I know people treat me different because of it. And the more I am aware of that and play into it, the more I become detached from the real world. So it's really about balance. The more somebody opens the door for me and I walk through without acknowledging that they opened the door for me, the more I become separate from others[|]I had a talk with Lauryn Hill and she said, "Try to completely throw away your ego." How many times can you throw away an ego, you know? It's tough. It's something we all battle with. I battle with it all the time and the idea of being in all these places—the big spots, all the events, the lights—it's all for your ego. It's all for your own confirmation to be like, okay, I'm somebody. But truthfully, you've always been somebody. You don't need the lights[|]I try to think about that. Also, I like to look at old pictures and think of things from back in the day that kind of draws me back to where I came from. I think a lot of times when artists are in so much of the now, they only think of what's ahead of them, which is cool. But I look at pictures of the small little apartment that I come from in Compton and things like that. And it always trips me out when I get too far out there where I'm missing phone calls or not responding to text messages on time or my peoples is hitting me, my moms is and I can't get back to her. Sometimes you on the go and you forget about those little things[|]It's definitely a gift and a curse when you make music as personal as I make it. Of course you get the kids out there that say that they relate to you and this song saved their lives, and you helped them with their assignment for this and that. And then at the same time, your privacy is not respected. And all entertainers go through it, but moreso the ones that make very personal music, because it's not just me you're focusing on now when I'm out in public, but also on individual characters that I'm talking about in my music. So that's a whole other ballgame and it's just something that I've gotta accept[|]When I'm completely drained of inspiration, that's when I'm finished with the project.I think the way it is, the positive aspect of me gaining more listeners and giving them some type of motivation and relatable effect, it's more than running from somebody snapping a picture of my mom's van that was on my album cover, that she actually still has. I'd never think that would happen, but it's happened plenty of times to where she has to hide the van now. She can't drive that thing no more. And she's old school, she wanna drive it. But I never want them to be in this type of world, because not everybody can handle it. I think the average person wouldn't be able to handle the day-to-day. It's a lot of things you gotta deal with. So me doing that, it's just a piece of me. I gotta find balance and try not to really get too frustrated over it[|]I'd be lying to you to say I knew good kid, m.A.A.d city would be as successful as it has been. In the beginning I was very doubtful. Once I was done, the jitters hit me so fast. I was so confident in making it, because I was like, "This is it, man. Nobody heard this story and if you heard it, you heard it in bits and pieces but I'm finna put it to you in a whole album—from Compton, from the hood, from the streets—it's a whole other perspective and light, I'ma go back and do the skits just like how Biggie and Dre and Snoop and 'Pac did it. And I'ma tell my story." Then I wrapped up with it and said, "Man, what's on the radio right now? I don't think they doin' skits and things like that." I don't know if the people are gonna understand what I'm talkin' about on this album because it's almost like a puzzle pieced together, and albums ain't been created like this in a long time. Albums that actually still reach the masses, at least[|]My whole outlook on being signed was to have an actual massive commercial successful album. This is what you think as a kid. You don't know nothing about creative process and things like that. So I didn't know how blessed I was to actually go and make an album that I can create and control 100 percent. When I was done with it, I was like, "Man, these people believe in me like this? They let me just do this whole thing by myself like this? I don't know. Y'all sure I'm right?"[|]I was nervous because I didn't think the people would understand it. And I get a call from Pharrell. He said he had a copy of the album and it's amazing. And I was like, that call was right on time because that was when I was feeling super insecure about it. Pharrell said, "Never feel that way again. When that little negative man come behind your head, always follow your first heart, and that was your first heart, to put the album out like this." This is his words verbatim, he said, "Watch what's gonna happen."[|]I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten.When I come up to certain artists, artists that I've always looked up to, and they can recite my records that wasn't the single, that puts me in a space where, okay, this is a person I always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me. I always thought confirmation would be having a lot of money, and things I could do for my family[|]Because that was what we was taught when you come from these urban neighborhoods, you was taught that having money was success and that's all you see, all you know. So once I got the money and everything else that comes with it, I felt like I wasn't satisfied. I'm looking around like, this is great security, but I don't even spend it on myself, I spend it on my loved ones. That makes me feel good knowing I can support somebody that's in need. But at the same time, I'm feeling like, okay, what's after this? So what I realized was, my greatest fulfillment of accomplishment was having somebody that I looked up to for so many years and knowing that I put in that same dedication and work and them saying, "Thank you." And them being able to recite them lyrics[|]Kendrick Lamar - Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe ([Explicit)]I think the first time I played "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe" for Andre 3000 was before it came out. I never share my album while I'm creating. I think that the situation with Andre was one of those things where he was in the studio with Dre and Dre was like, "Play some stuff ." I can't say no to Dr. Dre. But me creating music, I never really play music for anybody, even people inside the camp because it can almost sway your creative process 100 percent. So along with that, I cut off everything on the radio; I really just duck off from music. Because I'm gonna be influenced and I don't want to be. That has always been my process. I just feel like, it's really the only prized possession that I actually can control, you know? It's selfishness for sure, but it's my selfishness and I own it[|]I know a lot of people that go around and play music to get approval because some are not so confident in the things they do. But with me, personally, I can only speak for myself, this is me. Anything I say or do, I don't take back, I don't regret. That's how I was feeling at the time and that's how y'all gonna get it, and I own it. Love me or hate me, I own it. It is what it is. And that's how I look at it[|]From 13 years old to the time I was 21, I was in a mode of mastering how to be a rapper. Like a rapper's rapper, using my tongue as a sword, a fuckin' barbarian. That's all it was about, slaying words. So when I turned 21, 22, somewhere around there, I got into a mode where it became more of a writer aspect for me rather than just being a rapper 'cause this is around the same time where cats weren't putting out mixtapes anymore. They was putting out full bodies of work and wasn't even signed to a major label. So by that time, that's when I started developing and actually constructing my music from a writer's point of view. good kid, m.A.A.d city was probably one of them albums that you could unfold out into a book and read it. And that's how I treat everything. Everything is critical like that from here on out. It's the art of writing[|]So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, 'Who am I? Is this really what I'm supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What's my responsibility?'This is more than just music for me. This is actually a piece of me. I'm obsessed with it. And that's how I take it. When I make my music, it comes from a genuine space where I'm already spreading myself wide to the world. So during my process in creating it, that time is for me, personally. That's for my heart, those are my memories that helped me up with these lyrics and get inspiration. That was my memories. Taking those inspirations and going into that booth, that's something that I hold dear[|]When I'm completely drained of inspiration, that's when I'm finished with the project. When I start maybe trying to tamper with things that I shouldn't tamper with, I've already had done, that's when I'm done and I know I've exhausted inspiration. That comes with not wanting to actually rush the process. I always want to put it down to the last idea, and once I'm drawn away from it, that's when I say, okay, let's take all these pieces—they might not even be songs—let's take these pieces and construct it. So what I want to say, and how I want to execute it becomes clear[|]It's the best part because the things that I say on my records—this is another reason why I don't just play records for people—you won't necessarily get it until it's constructed. I know what type of artist I am. I'm not an artist that's gonna give you a single and say, "This is what my album's gonna sound like, go sell it." That's not me. I'm just not that artist to give you one or two songs here and there and run with it. Everybody has their own niche. With mine, I just own it, and I know that's exactly what that is. And I wanna keep that lane. I don't want to jump in somebody else's lane and try to do their moves because it may not work for me like it worked for them. So I stay where I feel like I'm inspired[|]What's crazy to me is that I feel the same energy now that I felt before my first album. I know there's lot of pressure for me on this new album but it don't necessarily scare me. It's almost confirmation, like, go in there and challenge yourself just the same way you challenged yourself the first time. Because I remember going to radio stations and them telling me this: "Dr. Dre had Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Eminem, you seen what Eminem did, right? Yeah, uh huh. Kendrick Lamar, he from the West Coast, and Compton, too. Dre from Compton, you see the legacy he left. Yeah, so I hope that album is good. Matter fact, you got the weight on your shoulders right now."[|]Thank you for that. Let me get in the studio now since you just put the battery in my back[|][Kendrick Lamar Covers XXL Magazine's Winter 2014 Issue]I thought I was going to win Best Rap Album at the Grammys. I put a lot of work in on my album and the biggest thing for me is knowing that it was basically an underground album. It didn't have big No. 1 records on it and there wasn't really any commercial hits. It was great songs and I think the message behind it reached as many listeners and believers as a super mainstream album. So for me, when you're saying, "rap," that would be my definition of something that deserved an accolade. Yep[|]I found out a lot about myself in these past two years. It's scary. I know more about myself now than any other point of my life. I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten. I was a pretty shy and to myself type of person as a kid. And now 15 years later I'm in front of people every day, tens of thousands of people. So that makes me more of a recluse. That makes me not come outside of my world on the outskirts of L.A. and bounce around different places and things like that[|]What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place.So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, "Who am I? Is this really what I'm supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What's my responsibility?" It's a real trippy thing, you feel me? And I think it's something that nobody can understand; only an artist can. Things change for you with success when you get money. I noticed when people started treating me a little bit different, the people that I cared about the most, my close friends and family. The artist don't necessarily change, it's usually the people around them. Their expectations of you can sometimes be out of control. You can do one thing that can trigger something mentally in them that makes them think that you don't care about them or you don't fuck with them no more when that's not the case. You're just more focused on what you have to do because it's bigger[|]The moment I start seeing change in people around me, that's when I know something is a little bit different. Then there's tension in the air that I probably can't necessarily deal with at the moment. 'Cause when the industry don't understand me, and the business don't understand me, these are the people I can run to. What happens when I can't run to them?[|]Artists just get paranoid in any situation and circumstance. I'm always paranoid. I'm already a person who thinks a lot; sometimes I may overthink things or think too much. So when you're put into a space where you feel like you can't necessarily trust your close ones, that can do some whole other crazy thing to you psychologically. Seriously. All you got is you and God at the end of the day[|]The hard time for me was probably when I was on the road. It's almost like you go on the road and you're gone for two years. And this place you've known your whole life, these people you've known your whole life, everything is different when you come back. And you feel like, damn, your sanctuary is now on that tour bus. That dirty, stinky, smelly tour bus. And that's one thing, among numerous other things, that have been hard sometimes. To the point where people are pulling for you left and right, where you feel like you don't have control over your own life. Over your own well-being[|]What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place. And I've seen and heard some of the greats go out because of it. And I'm saying this right now to let everyone know, it's real and you have to be mentally steady 100 percent in order to keep doing it at a high level and still maintain your sanity
