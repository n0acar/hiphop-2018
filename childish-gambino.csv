I. It all starts with "That Power" and "Camp",This world Donald has talked about creating was born way back in 2011 on his debut album "Camp", without us even being aware of it. The final track on the album, "That Power" features a large monologue spoken by Donald, or THE BOY, speaking about his experience with this girl whom he met on the camp. THE BOY is thirteen years old at this point[|][Quote: "That Power"][|]And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you haven't said "yes" or "no" yet. And regrettably I end up using the word "destiny."[|][End quote][|]When he runs out of things to say to this girl, he falls asleep, and wakes up at the pickup point where all the parents are collecting their kids. As he gets off the bus, the girls from the back of the bus run into THE BOY and mock him for what he said to the girl who he'd spent the bus ride home talking to. He expresses that he didn't know the girl was friends with these other girls, because it appears as though when THE BOY was asleep, the girl he was talking to decide to share what he told her[|]THE BOY states that he learned to cut out the middle man all the time and just tell everyone, because they're going to find out somehow anyway. [Maybe this is maybe why we're getting such a personal album from Donald in "Because The Internet", because he is cutting out the middle man and just expressing his feelings and emotions through is music.] THE BOY finishes[|][Quote: "That Power"][|]I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit. But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus. I still haven't[|][End quote][|]The album "Camp" seems to take place on a metaphorical camp. Rap Genius states that the first four tracks ("Outside", "Fire Fly", "Bonfire" and "All the Shine") are a representation of his childhood, rise to success, rise to fame and realisation that it's not all that it is cracked up to be[|]THE BOY mentions that he finds his dad in the parking lot and he goes back home, but at the end of the monologue he states that he still hasn't got off the bus. Maybe he did get off the bus at that point, but maybe there is something that stayed behind on the bus[|]Also, remember how he learned to cut out the middle man? Instagram
