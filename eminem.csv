The Night Before Christmas,Hey, Dave, 'twas the night before Christmas we'll go![|]Hi, boys, here I go![|]'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house[|]Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;[|]The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,[|]In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;[|]One, two, three, four, no, Dave, don't we wanna hear some more![|]The children were nestled all snug in their beds,[|]While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;[|]And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,[|]Had settled our heads for a long winter's nap,[|]When out on the lawn there a rose such a clatter,[|]I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.[|]Away to the window I flew like a flash,[|]Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.[|]The moon outside was shining on the snow[|]When the look will right on the ground below,[|]When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,[|]But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,[|]With a little old driver, so lively and quick,[|]I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.[|]More faster than eagles the reindeer came,[|]And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;[|]"Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen![|]On, Comet! On Cupid!

Youâ€™re Never Over,
Zane Lowe BBC Radio Interview Part 1,Zane Lowe: Welcome back to Radio One, Maida Vale studio 4 here we are. Part of the reason we're here obviously because its the BBC but also because we have Studio 3 around the corner and you've got the band set up and going to perform some songs as well.[|]Eminem: It's super exciting to be here. I was trying to figure out how I was going to top the publicity of yours and Kanye's interview so I decided I was going to walk in here, pee on the floor, and leave. I'm peeing right now. Alright see you guys later![|]ZL: Seeing you with the band, and seeing you perform the other night at the awards show and seeing you on the mic, it was, I don't think I've ever seen you more alive on the mic. It was full of energy and in the moment. What I noticed was as well was spitting live with the band behind you seemed to free you up a lot more. Are you feeling that way?[|]E: I think performing has gotten a lot different, it's gotten better with the band because there's just more elements to it and being it is a live show, there's more places you can go with it. There's things you can do with your hands, it's really cool, it's different. I think it's better.[|]ZL: Spitting Rap God that just puts everything into perspective I think for everybody else. When you wrote that and you got that one down and recorded it...[|]E: I didn't write that, I freestyled it, off the dome, 1 take.[|]ZL: Absolutely ridiculous. The song is ridiculous it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.[|]E: Thank you[|]ZL: When you get to perform that live that must be, I saw at the end once you finished that, that's a challenge for anybody. At the end you must feel like 'Wow'. That's a lot of rhymes to get through, it's like 5 or 6 minutes non-stop.[|]E: Um, Yeah the other night I don't think we did the whole song. We did kind of a Deadly Medley.[|]ZL: I don't even know how you would cut that up and make a shorter version of that because it's such a stream of consciousness through the whole track.[|]E: Yeah I don't know. I wouldn't even want to begin to think of that, because I think it is a... stream of consciousness. Nice stream of consciousness, running down my leg.[|]ZL: The album itself has been so well received by everyone including fans across the world. Because in my opinion listening to it now it's kinda the perfect combination of the venom and the danger that existed on the 1st record but also what you've been through and what you've learnt over the past 5 or 6 years. It's kind of like the combination of the two. Is that fair do you think? The first album that feels like it's slightly grown up, but also going back to some of those subject matters and dealing with that stuff.[|]E: It's grown up and down. I mean some of the themes and topics and things like that are revisited on this album, but at the same time I feel like its kind of a 2013 version. All my albums I think, for the most part, pretty much tell where I'm at, you know at each one at that time period, whatever. So this is kinda like, there's a lot of reflecting and things like that back on everything that was happening during that time, you know. And it's kinda like me reflecting on it and getting to the point where I am now with it.[|]ZL: Settling some scores as well, and burying the hatchets and dealing with stuff once and for all. Do you feel like this album has allowed you to do that?[|]E: I mean some stuff, yeah. But for the most part I just felt like it might be fun to just revisit that, the overall vibe of that album. Just because it started to go there in the recording process.[|]ZL: So when did that begin like you were going down that road?[|]E: I had started making a few records for it, and it just sounded like the tonality of it, the tones of the records kinda were heading towards that way. And I figured out what direction it should go in, kinda started gearing everything that way. And alotta times, making an album, I dont always have the direction or concept early on. Sometimes it doesn't come until the middle/towards the end of a record to figure out where I'm actually going with that... that's just a culmination of songs, and depending on what the vibe is. Sometimes I do a songs that is so left field one or two of them its like Oh Shit where am I going to put these songs and now what am I going to call it because its not going to make sense to go, let's say Recovery or whatever. But with this one I feel like I kinda got an earlier idea for a concept.[|]ZL: That must be nice actually to be able to sit down and carve it out as it was going and have that end result in mind, to piece it together that way.[|]E: It was, but it wasn't, in the sense of-- I had to record a lot of songs for it because I felt like if I'm going to call it that, I want it to make sense.[|]ZL: And the stakes are high as well. I was talking to someone about this before and they were saying, "Eminem would never consider one of his albums to be a classic" he's not that way inclined. But you know how people feel about the Marshall Mathers LP, it speaks volumes. And then the critics, every layer of it, it is considered a modern day classic album. Did you consider the expectation of calling it that and what it would mean to the record overall?[|]E: Yeah, I had kinda known that going in. Once I kinda new what direction I was going, I knew that I needed certain songs to be able to call it that, and like I said to be able to make sense. But, I just wanted to make sure that I had the right ones, and in other words, I knew that, obviously Stan off the first Mathers LP was a big topic. And I had heard a lot of chatter around the time doing the Recovery record that I should do Stan 2 and why doesn't he do Stan 2, and all I kept thinking was Stan's dead. You know what I'm saying, he died in the story. So in the back of my mind I kinda had an idea of who could be left from the story, but I needed to get the right beat and be able to...[|][plays song][|]ZL: As soon as it starts as well. Did you know immediately this would be the beat for this concept?[|]E: Yeah, as soon as I heard the words to the chorus... I got this beat, this beat was sent to me and had those words on it. And sometimes for me it's like- I like making my own choruses and its also fun for me to take someone else's words and interpret them my own way.[|]ZL: For sure, when you hear that chorus I'm sure initially... it's a 1st person scenario or self hatred scenario, but its tied into- there's layers to that. Being bad is good I hate to be it but here I am and I'm back again. And then you got to deal with the story, and at the end it's taking everyone to the end when you couldn't be facing down any more of the criticism both self and by others that you faced throughout your career. I mean it's the ultimate type of acknowledgement isn't it?[|]Meeting your maker almost really, is that the inspiration behind it?[|]E: It's kinda like saying, if you're going to go down this road, then you're going to call it this, and this is going to be the title, and this is all of these things coming back on me.[|]ZL: It's an amazing opening to the record and it's really ambitious as well. So you set the bar really really high and from here we go to Rhyme or Reason, and I love that beat and love the big samples and first time you reference Rick Rubin as a producer on the record. When did you first have the idea of working with Rick?[|]E: I've always been a fan of Rick's, and my manager Paul had been talking to him and Rick had expressed that he had interest in working with me. And when Paul brought it to my attention I was like super excited, honored at the fact that he was even thinking about it. I had my reservations just because I felt like I'm a super fan of Rick, and I'd probably be a little nervous and wouldn't know what the vibe would be because I would be wanting to impress him. It was very much the feeling that I got early on with Dre.[|]ZL: Had you met Rick before?[|]E: Nah, I'd never met him. So I was like nervous to meet him and you know, even more nervous to work with him.[|]ZL: Same thing with Dre, all the way back, same kind of experience when you walked in the studio and saw Dre that time..[|]E: Yeah I'm still always trying to impress Dre too to this day at the same time. But I just kept thinking if I got in the studio with Rick, what if we're not able to come up with anything. I had all these things in my head, and then when I met him, the guy's so laid back, it made it easy. And his vibe in the studio is very much like... "Try whatever", don't be afraid to try whatever, even if the idea in the beginning is stupid. Because a lot of ideas in the beginning stages, not mine of course, mine are just insane from the moment I think of them- but sometimes ideas are not always the greatest.[|]ZL: Don't be afraid to fail to get somewhere else, to get on the journey.[|]E: So if you say one thing that's going to spark another thing to lead to a better thought, that's kinda how it went. We started going through old break beats and I was trying to tell him I kinda had the idea, I kinda had a notion that I was going to call it the Marshall Mathers LP 2, but I didn't want to say anything yet to him because I wasn't 100 percent sure- and I wanted to make sure that I had enough songs to even play for him that would make sense. I love the sound that Rick gets when he does hip hop. Even from early on, Beastie Boys- it's incredible. And that's what I was kinda hoping to get.[|]How can I make the record sound nostalgic, but subliminally nostalgic. So it reminded you of maybe 13 years ago when you first heard me but its overs beats that are even older, but you're not sure why you feel this way. Tried to create a feel, so we started messing with old samples and break beats and things like that- cuz Rick is super talented and mastered of every other genre of music as well. The way he dips in and out of just different genres is crazy to me. Like I said, I was hoping to get what I got from him.[|]ZL: The first time I saw Berzerk as well, I was so happy to see the way that you came through, and the video the way the colors were so reverse Beastie Boy style- it was fan boy stuff for me. To be able to go out in a beanie like the Ad-Rock thing and it was cool, I love that.
Zane Lowe BBC Radio Interview Part 2,[Snippet from "Brainless"][|]"Who can say for sure? Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer[|]If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use[|]Society will reap a great benefit."[|][Zane Lowe][|]Let's talk about your work on the record as a producer, because I know on Relapse you did nothing, on Recovery you got back into it, I've always said to you as long as I've know you or you've been making beats how much of a fan I am of your particular music, your production for others as well as just for yourself.[|][Eminem][|]Oh, thank you.[|][Zane Lowe][|]And so to hear you back making beats again on some of the standout beats on the record was a real thrill. So, I mean, how was that getting back into the producer's chair and deciding to wear two hats again?[|][Eminem][|]Urm, I mean that was fun, it was fun to, to be able to, just mess around with beats from scratch again and, you know, sometimes, like, I think Recovery was the first time that I ever got really super-open to, urr, working with a lot of other producers, you know that was the most I had ever done, and, you know, aside from working with Dre. You know, so, on that album kind of opened those doors a little bit, so that's kinda how early on, we started approaching this record, or this album, and sometimes, like I may get something in my head like an idea or the mood of something that I would want and I'm not always gonna get that by going through, you know, different tracks if other people have made, they don't know what's in my head, you know what I'm saying, so it's also a good way to, ur, I think maybe it helps with diversity a little bit too, with the sound and all that, you know, I would get something in my head and wanna be able to lay that idea down from scratch.[|][Zane Lowe][|]It just sounds like your being inspired by rap, in a big big way, I mean...[|][Eminem][|]Absolutely[|][Zane Lowe][|]I mean, I know you've always been that way, we've known each other for a long time and I've met you at various points throughout every album and I know that it's...[|][Eminem][|]I just met you, out there I thought... It's all good man, I'm still peeling the floors. (Laughter)[|][Zane Lowe][|]Um, you know and the music reflects your head space, it's always been pretty honest, not just lyrically but also musically I mean there was a time when the beats you were making were all very kind of minor key and lots of strings and lots of, kind of, a lot of Drama. The beats on here are fun. I mean, they're fat, big and rap! Like inspired by hip-hop![|][Eminem][|]Yeah, I mean, it's pretty much all I do, and all I wanna do, you know what I'm saying like, so it's fun for me, like I'm still, you know, like I'm still passionate about hip-hop, and every aspect of it, so, making beats and producing, you know, is definitely, it's fun for me.[|][Zane Lowe][|]What is it about rap that you love? I mean I'm a huge, I mean I grew up on hip-hop and it forms pretty much every sort of thing I've ever done in my life pretty much to some form, and what I wondered, you know, being someone who is considered one of the greatest of all time, what is it about rap the art form, if you can even trace it back to when you first discovered it, to how you feel about it now and what are your most rap-heavy records?[|][Eminem][|]You know, just a lot of rap.[|][Zane Lowe][|]A lot of rapping on there, a lot of words?[|][Eminem][|]Yeah[|][Zane Lowe][|]What is it about it that you love, if you can put it into words?[|][Eminem][|]Hmm, I dunno, I, urm, I love the fact that you can, I love the expression of it. The fact that you can, you know, just, I don't know, I love the, I love beats and rhymes and I love the fact that you can express yourself in a rhyme and lay it down and it can be therapeutic, and you've got it off your chest, and then you could go on to the next thing, I don't know, there's so much shit that I love about rap, you know, I'm in it for like, I love to watch what's going on in the game and keep my finger on the pulse of that, you know, and it's exciting to watch as a fan, for me too, you know, just being a fan of hip-hop, urm, and watching as it, you know, the evolution of it, and, you know, how it moves from each year to year, you know what I'm saying, the direction, and...[|][Zane Lowe][|]Are you sort of relieved that you can be that now, you can be a contender for the world's greatest rapper along with a selection of your peers and it can be a really amazing rap record and to a certain extent, I hope you take this the right way because I know your strong career, very popular, number 1 in 80+ countries, huge, but the pop stars kind of did, you know, in the sense of what people expect from you these days, isn't it, you don't have to be that guy any more, you can just be a rapper and make rap records if you want. Is that a relief?[|][Eminem][|]Well, yeah, I think so, urm, it's one of them things like, as far as like, being a pop star or whatever like, I never, never intended to be any of that, you know wha I'm saying, like, all I ever wanted to do was get respect from, you know, my peers and other rappers, and, urm, all the other stuff that came with it was just, you know, confusing to me, it was, I don't know, like I don't feel like I ever set out to make a pop song or a song that was gonna be some kind of crossover song or whatever... is that for me?[|][Zane Lowe][|]Yeah, if you want it.[|][Eminem][|]Thanks man, appreciate it. Urm...[|][Zane Lowe][|]And then boom, you did! And it didn't stop for years![|][Eminem][|]Well boom, it happened but at the same time, like - I never wanted to - when things did did keep happening and when certain things kept hitting the radio and things like that, I mean, I don't think I'm stupid. I'm not stupid. Like, I know when a song has a certain particular sound and sounds like "well maybe this could possibly be a radio record", or when I'm going "fuck, shit, ass!" you know what I'm saying, and I know "this will never go to radio". But at the same time, if a song starts heading that way, cause a lot of times I may even think, I may even think certain things when I'm writing it, like, maybe what person this might connect with, you know what I'm saying like, and who I might connect with with this song. But I never, in making any song I have made, I never wanted to compromise lyrical integrity, yeah, you know, and I always wanted to make sure that if I was rapping on a beat that had some kind of appeal to it and was catchy, that I was at least doing my job as an MC, and you know what I'm saying...[|][Zane Lowe][|]Oh that's the struggle![|][Eminem][|]And doing what I feel like I need to do.[|][Zane Lowe][|]That's tough man, because you want to give as much quality as you possibly can through your music, you're not going to hold yourself back in case you get successful, but at the same time like you say it's never been on the agenda, and I guess in a way that was part of what caused the problem in the first place that just manifested over that time, huh, like, how do I do both? How do I be good and not court this, not be this guy that everybody expects something from?[|][Eminem][|]Yeah, urm, I know that early on I went through a lot of that with the "Hi, my name is" record, and it was, urm, like I never understood, like I understood that the record was funny, and i understood that it was a little, urm, how you say, kitschy, or whatever, and maybe the hook was, the whole record was tongue-in-cheek. You know what I'm saying, like I'm still doing a lot of records like that to this day, with the tongue-in-cheek, but that record in particular was just like, it was my, it was almost like my anti-pop song cause it was like my hello to the world but it was my "fuck you" to the world at the same time. So I never understood, like, when all that started happening, like holy shit how did that become a, you know, I guess pop song.[|][Zane Lowe][|]So when did the penny drop and you realized the more you say "fuck you", the more people are gonna say, you know, "hi, we love you"?[|][Eminem][|]Urm, I don't know, I mean...[|][Zane Lowe][|]Probably around the Marshall Mathers LP right, cause that's when it really started to, to blow up again?[|][Eminem][|]Yeah, I think, I think there was a lot of that, and I think that just, coming from being an underground MC and being an underdog and things like that kinda gave me that attitude I think, you know, I think that had a lot to do with it, and then, you know, watching NWA and other people, 2Pac, you know what I'm saying, like, it was like, he's not going to, him or they, aren't going to kiss your ass to make you like their music.[|][Zane Lowe over snippet from "Survival"][|]Yeah, that's exactly what they want to do, let things slide a bit, you know. Now, you kind of talk about that on this song here, on The Monster (plays snippet from "The Monster"), and I think this is the one where you really address it in the most eloquent way about like, it's the gift and the curse, you know, I'm aware of the trouble it can get you in, I've been through that, you know. Number 1 album, number 1 movie, number 1 this number 1 that, not really in a position to really, kind of, really, be able to absorb that, yet, it's intoxicating, isn't it?[|][Eminem][|]Yeah, it was like, it was this thing, where, and I'm not gonna lie, I still wish it today, that it was like this thing where I want this attention for this music, but then I wanna be able to go in public, and I wanna be able to eat a fucking sandwich, you know what I mean, and be left alone. So, it was like "man, if I could...", because, I'd never been an attention seeker, and it seems like a hell of a career choice, you know, but, I don't like attention, that's not just why I do it, just to get attention, I don't like to be in public and walk around and be, like, here I am, you know what I mean, like, it's not what I want, I just wanted, my dream was, my dream was for like, fuck man, to be able to one day, like hear rappers that I look up to on the radio, like "yo, what if Jay Z, whoever, what if they heard of me, what if they thought I was dope? You know what I'm saying like? That was where my mentality always was, was with it. So when it all went crazy it was really hard to wrap my head around, you know, a lot of it still is, but especially back then.[|][Zane Lowe][|]Yeah. You know, you have done something which very few people have done now, you've actually been at the center of the world, the center of that storm, and you've emerged out of it, you popped out of the other side of it, I mean. Elvis didn't do that, you know, Michael Jackson didn't do that, Whitney Houston... a lot of people who have been in the public eye to that extent, unfortunately the list of various reasons, I'm sure personal to them, is too long, who didn't make it through. You have, and what does the world look like to you, when you've come out the other side of that, and you're 5 years sober and you're looking on that chaos for some perspective?[|][Eminem][|]Urm, I don't know, I mean I'm definitely thankful, you know what I mean, I know that could have certainly took another path...[|][Zane Lowe][|]And gone that way, yeah.[|][Eminem][|]Yeah, I could have went another direction but, I don't know, I mean, I think that, I feel like, like I'm probably able to see it, I'm able to be more focused now than I've ever been, urm, but I'm also able to I guess put it in perspective. The problem is I can't put a lot of perspective because I don't, there's a lot that's, you know, gone, there's a lot that I don't remember, and maybe that's cool, too, you know what I'm saying, where...[|][Zane Lowe][|]Probably a good thing?[|][Eminem][|]Yeah but, I don't know man, I know, I know that, there's so many addicts in this world, you know, and people who have problems like that, that don't make it, you know what I'm saying so I, I'm thankful for that, but urr, you know, I think that's one thing that really helps me, urr, through, and just, keeps me pushing forward is the music, is the passion for that and, and, and, you know.
